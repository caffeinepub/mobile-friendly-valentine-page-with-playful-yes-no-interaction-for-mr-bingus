Some REQ-1 details (exact prompt text / exactly two buttons) cannot be fully verified due to truncation of App.tsx.",

      "reason": "The UI references `/assets/generated/valentine-yes-meme.dim_1024x1024.png`, but the diff summary does not show any new file added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (only LLM-readable files are listed, and no asset file addition is evidenced).",
